    <h2>Publication history</h2>
    <h3>Premiere</h3>
    <p>Following the success of the Fantastic Four in 1961 and the subsequent revival
         of superhero comic books, Marvel set about creating new superhero characters. 
         During this time, Stan Lee developed the initial concept for Iron Man.

 <h3>Solo Series</h3>
     <p>     Lee was interested in making an unlikeable character likeable, saying that he 
          "thought it would be fun to take the kind of character that nobody would like,
           none of [Marvel's] readers would like, and shove him down their throats and make 
           them like him".

    <h2>Fictional character biography</h2>
    <p>Tony Stark inherited his family's business, Stark Industries, after his parents were 
        killed in a car crash.[69] Developing equipment for the U.S. military, he travels to 
        a war zone to conduct a weapons test when he triggers a booby trap. His heart is 
        critically injured by shrapnel, and he is captured by the communist Wong-Chu, who 
        demands that Tony build him a weapon. Tony instead builds a suit of armor that sustains
         his heart, becoming Iron Man.[15][5] The war zone that Tony visits has been changed
         multiple times by different writers to correspond with the character's age, which is
         explained by a "sliding scale of continuity" in which the timing of significant events
         in the world of Marvel may change</p>
